  description: "You tear yourself away as if your body was velcro. Each hand latches
    to the ladder rods as if you are holding on the edge of a cliff. You don\u2019t
    know exactly why you are pushing so hard. You know you must. This will end the
    way you want it to. The light of the outside stands before you, sweet smells
    of pine and pollen. Normally, you\u2019d sneeze. Today, you wouldn\u2019t want
    anything less.\r"
