BACKGROUND CHANGER 6783



idea 1:
>have one sprite object where the backgrounds will be shown in game (put and position in scene tree)(done)


>assign a sprite in the room scriptable object (ex.room_bedroom goes the bedroom background sprite bg...)
	declare the sprite in room.cs(done)
>along with displaying new room text for each room, this ALSO calls DisplayRoomBackground(); which SETS the sprite of the main game background sprite to the current room/area background.

display room background in gamecontroller.cs:
	set display background to current background sprite


@ i have referenced the display background in GameController.cs



Room.cs: Sprite background is defined, giving each room its prescribed SPRITE in engine inspector!

RoomNavigation1: along with defining Room currentRoom, defines currentBackground (accesible in GameController inspector) -->IF SPRITE IS SPECIFIED, IT DOES SHOW IN GAME... NEED TO ENSURE IT SETS THIS VARIABLE WHEN IT CALLS DISPLAYROOMBACKGROUND! 
	>link the room.cs Sprite background to currentBackground, same way tutorial did it? <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<







done




after this: figure how to call the fade animations...
