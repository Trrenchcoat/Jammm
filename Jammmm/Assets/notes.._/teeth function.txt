public void brushTeeth() {
//a function that:
>makes cursor visible(done)
>sets cursor icon to the toothbrush sprite(done)
>slows the speed of the cursor, maybe an effect
>starts a timer of 10 seconds,(done)
>teeth brushing noise while cursor moves in specific area of screen (supposed mouth)?????????????

	>change current room to looking back at the sink (drain speaking)?????
	>reactivate inputfield(done)
}
