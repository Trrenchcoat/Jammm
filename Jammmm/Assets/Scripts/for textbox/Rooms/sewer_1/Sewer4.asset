  description: "You feel your back stiffen from years of unkept posture and isolation.
    Muscles contorting with each step you take, pops begin to resonate from your
    kneecaps. Your skin feels wilted. Each breath you take seems to go straight behind
    your eyes, creating a phantom smell of something you cannot remember. The slight
    wind reminds you of the faint hope of an end to this tunnel.\r"
