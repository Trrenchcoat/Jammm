  description: "Barely out of sight, a shine under the water blanket catches your
    eye. A reflective, unsanded, cracked section of glass rests against the metal
    piping. With each step, you can see the gathering of roaches around the singular
    item along your path. When you look inside\u2026\r\n\r\nAny small crack you can
    see: squelching erupts, causing you to stumble backwards. An amalgamation of
    parts you find so familiar stretches and forms tendons, grows hair, molding into
    every \u201Cwhat could have been.\u201D\r"
  currRoomInputPlaceholder: ' Take a closer look at the amalgam. You desperately
    crave to relive the memories.'
