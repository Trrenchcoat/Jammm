  description: "Nothing has interested you for a while now. You used to have so many
    hobbies, friends, and ambitions. You felt healthy. Not only that, but you felt
    happy. Happy. You overdid it. How do you put too many eggs in one basket if you
    have no eggs and no basket? You\u2019re exhausted, heaving each breath as if
    you just ran a marathon. Your neck holds rings of bruises, scars spread about
    your skin. You can\u2019t hide them anymore.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nowhere else
    to go, you know what to do.\r\n"
