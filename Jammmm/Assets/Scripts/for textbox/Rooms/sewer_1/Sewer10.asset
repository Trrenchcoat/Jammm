  description: "You need to look away. With the last of your energy, you sprint away
    from the amalgam. It is there. You\u2019re finally looking in the mirror. Every

    magnetizing to the entity. There\u2019s a ladder to your right. \r\n\r\nYou need
    to break free. The comfortability of being consumed for so long, you wish for
    those memories behind you to come out to the light. You saw yourself. You don\u2019t
    need to drown. Get out.\r\n"
